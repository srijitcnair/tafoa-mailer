			+ "<p>Then, TAFOA representative raised the issue of commercial activity being not allowed by the construction agreement with CG and the by-laws of TAFOA. The police indicated that if it were a law and order situation (like it has happened a few times already), they will have a role in it but the solution lies in filing a legal suit against those owners who are not following the by-laws. This has been the advice of the lawyer, as well.</p>"
			+ "<p>The members of TAFOA have been hesitant to take legal action against the PG flat owners because –"
			+ "<ol><li>It will vitiate the harmony amongst the owners / residents</li>"
			+ "<li>When the EB comes to know of the commercial activity happening in these units, the tax / tariff rates are likely to be changed to commercial – reversing them later will be tough for the owners.</li>"
			+ "<li>For those owners who are not in Chennai, it will be a physical hardship to come and attend the hearings.</li>"
			+ "<li>Some of the owners have already confirmed that they will be following the by-laws and have asked for a reasonable extension to stop PG accommodation.</li>"
			+ "<li>Proactive verbal talks are on with a few other PG accommodation owners who have indicated to be in consonance with the by-laws and are working out the modalities with their tenants / PG managers.</li>"
			+ "</ol>"
			+ "<p>It will be increasingly difficult to not pursue this alternative of a legal suit with those owners who have still not confirmed their stand on this issue and we sincerely hope that they officially confirm their commitment before the deadline of Nov 21st. </p>"
			+ "<p>Against this background and as advised by the legal counsel (and the police), TAFOA is proceeding with filing a complaint against Beehive OMR  (only) with the Corporation Commissioner regarding their legality of running a commercial activity in residential premises.</p>";
